Howdy, welcome to my site! My name is Victor and I am an [Engineering Science](https://www.sfu.ca/engineering/prospective-students/undergraduate-students/programs.html) student at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, BC.
I like tech.
i enjoy sharing things on the internet:
- [posts](posts/) i shared;
- [experience](about/experience.md) or summary of what i have done;
- [projects](about/projects.md) i (and my teammates) have built;
