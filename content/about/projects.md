## Plate Pets

This project came to be at the 2024 Storm Hacks Hackathon at SFU Burnaby campus. Working in a group of 4 of my closest engineering friends, we created an educational children's game that teaches children about certain animals' favourite foods. Running on a Raspberry Pi and coded exclusively in Python, this project uses a PN532 NFC module and implements Adafruit's PN532 library to read and process UIDs from NFC tags. It also implements the Pygame library to animate the relevant animal and food pairs.

Stack: Python, Thonny IDE, Raspbian, Pygame, Github Desktop

## 2D DCT Image Compression

This project was completed for the Introduction to Engineering Analysis course at SFU. For this project, I utilized MATLAB to convert an image to the DCT domain by applying the 8-point Discrete Cosine Transform. By implementing uniform quantization of the imageâ€™s 2D DCT coefficients using bins of equal size, I removed small coefficients from the data, then used the Inverse 2D Discrete Cosine Transform to convert reconstructed DCT coefficients to the original domain to allow for visual feedback.

Stack: MATLAB
